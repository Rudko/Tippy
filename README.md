# Pre-work - *Tippy Dark Mode*

**Tippy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Grigory Rudko**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [YES] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [YES] Custom font
* [YES] UI animations – for the Keyboard
* [YES] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- INSTEAD OF ANIMATION I USE BLURRED PREVIEW FROM BACK CAMERA AS A BACKGROUND
- AFTER KEYBOARD DISAPPEARS YOU CAN SEE TOTAL AMOUNT DEVIDED FOR 2, 3, 4 AND 5 PERSONS 

- [COMING SOON ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
It took me some time to figure out how I can use preview from Back Camera as a background.
